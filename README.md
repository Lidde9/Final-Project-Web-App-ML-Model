# Final-Project-Web-App-ML-Model
Deploying machine learning models on a web application (Python, Sci-kit Learn/sklearn, Gradio, OpenAI, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn, joblib)

This is the final project for Nod Coding Bootcamp. The goal of the project is to predict what skin disease a person has based on visual inspection of the skin (12 questions) or another 22 skin attributes from skin samples (microscopic evaluation). The model (ML Classification) diagnoses you with one out of 6 skin diseases based on your input. The model is trained on a data of 366 patients which all had one of these skin diseases.

The models are deployed to a web application using gradio, where after the model gives you diagnosis, ChatGPT gives a summary of the diagnosis, advice on how to treat it and how it could evolve through your life. Please see presentation for full summary of project.
